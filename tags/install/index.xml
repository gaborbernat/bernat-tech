&lt;p&gt;[In my previous post](https://bernat.tech/posts/pep-517-and-python-packaging/) I&amp;rsquo;ve described how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to install three
types of content: source tree, source distribution, and wheels. Only the last two types are uploaded to PyPI, the
central Python repository. However, one could get its hands on a source tree (by feeding, for example, a git protocol
