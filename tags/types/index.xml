There is no plan to change this. Nevertheless, in September 2014 Guido van Rossum (Python BDFL) created a python enhancement proposal (PEP-484) to add type hints to Python. It has been released for general usage a year later, in September 2015, as part of Python 3.5.0. Twenty-five years into its existence now there was a standard way to add type information to Python code.</description></item></channel></rss>
