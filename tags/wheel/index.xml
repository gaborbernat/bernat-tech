On the feature list, most notably, it now supports PEP-517, which by default is turned on when that the project has a pyproject.toml at the root folder. The PEP in question has been created in 2015 and accepted in 2017. Even though it took a while until pip implemented it, the release and the issues that followed confirmed that many people are not familiar with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
